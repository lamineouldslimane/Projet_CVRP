# VehicleRoutingProblem

The research work on Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (C-VRP) solving via Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Algorithm which enhanced with *Local Search*.

All the project is in that folder in this file we are going to explain all the files :

1- Folder Algorithm you will find 3 python files how contain the Artificial bee colony algorithm 
2- Folder Benchmark you will find all the .vrp file it's files how contain all generated data for the problems you can open them with VSCode.

3- Folder Output you will find all the solution of every problem in files .sol but you can open them with Texteditor and images for the result 

4- Folder Tools you will find python files how contain script fo generateing data and other function that we needed to solve the problem 


the diffirence between benchmark A and B in the B we use only 300 epoch (number of irritation of random swipe) and in the benchmark A we use 400 epoch
